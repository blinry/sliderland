# Sliderland

A (very) minimalist creative coding playground. Make animations using only 64 HTML sliders!

## Credits

- The recording feature uses [ffmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm)
- The font is [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/)
- An obvious inspiration is [tixy.land](https://tixy.land), which uses about 0.5 dimensions more
